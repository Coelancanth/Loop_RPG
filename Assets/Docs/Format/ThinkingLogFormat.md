# Requirement Analysis Format

## **Background and Objectives**  
- **Purpose:** Briefly describe the function or role of this module within the overall system.  
- **Reason:** Explain why this functionality needs to be developed.  

---

## **Functional Requirements**  
- Refine the functional requirements into specific items based on the system design document.  
- Use a numbered list (e.g., FR1, FR2) to clearly label each functional point.  

**Example:**  
**FR1:** Functional requirement description  
- **Input:** Data or parameters  
- **Output:** Result or format  

---

## **Non-Functional Requirements**  
- Describe the requirements for performance, scalability, maintainability, reusability, etc.  

**Example:**  
1. **Performance Requirements:** System response time, throughput, etc.  
2. **Scalability:** Support for future functional expansion or modifications.  
3. **Maintainability:** Ensure the code structure is clear and easy to maintain or upgrade.  
4. **Reproducibility:** Ensure consistent results under identical conditions.  

---

## **Input/Output Data**  
- List the **input data** and **output results** of the module, including data formats or data types.  

**Example:**  
- **Input:**  
   - Parameter1: Data type / format  
   - Parameter2: Data type / format  

- **Output:**  
   - Result1: Data type / format  

---

## **Dependencies and Constraints**  
- **Dependencies:** List the module's dependencies on other systems, components, or tools.  
- **Constraints:** List the technical, design, or business limitations.  

**Example:**  
- **Dependencies:**  
   - Component A: Provides functionality B  
   - Library X: Supports data parsing  

- **Constraints:**  
   - Must complete processing within a fixed time.  
   - The module's resource consumption must not exceed a defined threshold.  

---

## **Success Criteria and Boundary Conditions**  
- **Success Criteria:** Describe the acceptance standards for the module, defining when it can be considered "complete."  
- **Boundary Conditions:** Define the module's scope and limitations for external interactions.  

**Example:**  
- **Success Criteria:**  
   1. When input parameter A is provided, the module outputs result B.  
   2. The system generates consistent results for identical inputs.  

- **Boundary Conditions:**  
   1. The module only processes input data in a specific format.  
   2. If certain parameters are not provided, default values are used as output criteria.  


# Implementation Plan Format

## **Introduction**  
This implementation plan outlines the steps to develop the `PathInitializer` module as described in the design document. The module is responsible for generating a closed-loop path using a strategy pattern and integrating with the `RandomManager` for seed-based randomness.  

---

## **Core Tasks**  
1. **Define Interfaces and Enums**  
   - Create the `IPathInitializationStrategy` interface for path generation strategies.  
   - Define the `CharacterClass` enum to represent different character types.  

2. **Implement Core Components**  
   - Develop the `PathInitializer` class: Manages strategy selection and seed-based path generation.  
   - Implement the `DefaultPathStrategy` class: A basic path generation algorithm.  

3. **Integrate Dependencies**  
   - Integrate `RandomManager` for seed-based randomization.  
   - Prepare data output format (`List<Vector2Int>`) for compatibility with the Tile System.  

4. **Add Path Validation**  
   - Implement validation logic to ensure paths are:  
     - Closed loops.  
     - Free of intersections or invalid tiles.  

5. **Testing and Debugging**  
   - Write unit tests for:  
     - Path strategies.  
     - Seed-based reproducibility.  
     - Path validation logic.  
   - Test edge cases (e.g., invalid lengths or seeds).
